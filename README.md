This project analyzes a traffic accident dataset to uncover patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day using Python. The dataset is preprocessed to
extract key features such as accident date, time, and conditions, enabling a detailed examination of accident trends. Visualizations include histograms and count plots
that reveal the distribution of accidents across different times of the day, various weather conditions, and road surface states. Additionally, a scatter plot highlights
geographic accident hotspots, providing a comprehensive overview of the factors contributing to traffic accidents.
